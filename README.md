## Overview

Over the years I've created many DevSecOps Reference architectures for the various organizations that I've worked at. One of the [largest architectures](https://www.sonatype.com/resources/white-paper-test-drive-a-devsecops-reference-architecture) I've created was when I was working as a DevSecOps Evangelist at Sonatype. I've been asked many times for some of the tools and utilities that I've used to create these architectures, and this is what this repository is meant to help with.

## Tools and Content

This repository contains the following tools and content:

| Content | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Draw.io pipeline libraries | [drawio/libaries](drawio/libraries/) | You can find all of the cool subway pipeline graphics you may have seen in my reference architectures in this draw.io importable library. All components are sized at 80pt x 80pt so they can be easily snapped together to create diagrams. |
| Product Images | [img/products](img/products/) | This folder contains product logos for many DevOps related tools (open and closed source). Where possible, files end in ```-logo``` for a full logo and ```-icon``` for a product icon. |
| Vendor Images | [img/vendors](img/vendors/) | This folder contains vendor logos for companies that you'll regularly encounter when building out DevOps/DevSecOps pipelines. Where possible, files end in ```-logo``` for a full logo and ```-icon``` for a product icon. |

## Using the diagrams.net (draw.io) pipeline library

### Get draw.io
[diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) (previously draw.io) is a free and open source cross-platform graph drawing software developed in HTML5 and JavaScript. Its interface can be used to create diagrams such as flowcharts, wireframes, UML diagrams, organizational charts, and network diagrams. You can download an entire working copy from the website, or from [github.com](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop). It's also available as a snap if you are using Ubuntu.

### Open the pipeline-shapes libary

1. Once you open Draw.io, select "Open Library" from the "File" Menu

2. Open the [pipeline-shapes.xml](drawio/libraries/pipeline-shapes.xml) file.

3. Start drawing!

## Vendor and product logo addition or removal requests
If you would like to add a logo for your organization and/or product to this repository, please create an [addition request](https://github.com/djschleen/devsecops-architecture-tools/issues/new/choose). Your request will be reviewed and added to the repository if it is a DevOps/DevSecOps related tool.

Please provide as much information in the request as possible. You may see your product appear in my next reference architecture. I love to try out new tools as well, so feel free to provide any demo information.

## Important note about vendor and product Logos
I've gathered many high quality vendor and product logos from around the Internet and through the various relationships I've had with the vendor community and included them here. It's important to note that all logos and images are the sole property of their respective owners. If you are a trademark or copyright owner and *DO NOT* want your logos to be in this repository, please create a [removal request](https://github.com/djschleen/devsecops-architecture-tools/issues/new/choose) in this repository to request removal.

## Reference Architectures
### Sonatype DevSecOps Reference Architecture

Successful DevSecOps practices encompass people, processes, tools, and measurement.

But where should you start, how can you validate your existing practices, and what are the possibilities? This reference architecture file helps also you answer the following questions:

* Where can we further automate manual, security, and business tasks?
* What DevSecOps tools and integrations are others deploying?
* What interactions do we need to be aware of or map out?

View, modify, and save a version customized to your needs. Our draw.io file format can be used with draw.io, Visio, and Lucidchart. A static PDF version is also available.
