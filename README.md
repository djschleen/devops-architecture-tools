## Overview

Over the years I've created many DevSecOps Reference architectures for the various organizations that I've worked at. One of the largest architectures I've created was when I was working as a DevSecOps Evangelist at Sonatype. I've been asked many times for some of the tools and utilities that I've used to create these architectures, and this is what this repository is meant to help with.

## Tools and Content

This repository contains the following tools and content:

| Content | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Draw.io pipeline libraries | [drawio/libaries](drawio/libraries/) | You can find all of the cool subway pipeline graphics you may have seen in my reference architectures in this draw.io importable library. All components are sized at 80pt x 80pt so they can be easily snapped together to create diagrams. |
| Product Images | [img/products](img/products/) | This folder contains product logos for many DevOps related tools (open and closed source). Where possible, files end in ```-logo``` for a full logo and ```-icon``` for a product icon. |
| Vendor Images | [img/vendors](img/vendors/) | This folder contains vendor logos for companies that you'll regularly encounter when building out DevOps/DevSecOps pipelines. Where possible, files end in ```-logo``` for a full logo and ```-icon``` for a product icon. |

## Important note about vendor and product Logos
I've gathered many high quality vendor and product logos from around the Internet and through the various relationships I've had with the vendor community and included them here. It's important to note that all logos and images are the sole property of their respective owners. If you are a trademark or copyright owner and *DO NOT* want your logos to be in this repository, please create an Issue in this repository to request removal.

## Reference Architectures
### Sonatype DevSecOps Reference Architecture

Successful DevSecOps practices encompass people, processes, tools, and measurement.

But where should you start, how can you validate your existing practices, and what are the possibilities? This reference architecture file helps also you answer the following questions:

* Where can we further automate manual, security, and business tasks?
* What DevSecOps tools and integrations are others deploying?
* What interactions do we need to be aware of or map out?

View, modify, and save a version customized to your needs. Our draw.io file format can be used with draw.io, Visio, and Lucidchart. A static PDF version is also available.
